```js
const convert = (minutes) => minutes * 60
```

## Strategy

The provided strategy involves a mathematical approach to convert minutes to seconds. Instead of using conditional statements or a predefined list of possible answers, this approach directly calculates the number of seconds from the input minutes using a simple formula.

## Implementation

**Mathematical Formula:**: The number of seconds can be calculated by multiplying the input number of minutes by 60, as there are 60 seconds in a minute.

## Possible Refactors

This strategy could also be implemented using these 
Implementation ...

- Arrow Function with Implicit Return: Implement the function using an arrow function with implicit return syntax (=>). This makes the code more concise.
- Bitwise Operators: Consider using bitwise operators for arithmetic operations if applicable. However, for simple multiplication, bitwise operators may not be necessary.
- Unit Tests: Write unit tests to ensure the function behaves as expected for different input values.

This implementation follows the mathematical approach described in the strategy.
It's concise, straightforward, and efficiently converts minutes to seconds using a simple formula.
