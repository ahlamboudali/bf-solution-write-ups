```js
function convert(minutes) {
  return  minutes * 60;
}
```

## Strategy

The strategy is to directly convert the input number of minutes to seconds by multiplying it by 60. This approach avoids the need for conditionals or complex logic, leveraging the simple relationship between minutes and seconds.

## Implementation

Mathematical Formula:
The number of seconds is obtained by multiplying the input number of minutes by 60.

## Possible Refactors
- Arrow Function: You could refactor the function to use arrow function syntax for a more concise expression.
- Unit Tests: Writing unit tests to verify the behavior of the function under different scenarios can enhance its reliability.
